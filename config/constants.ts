Input parameters:
- NUM_QUESTIONS: ${num_questions}
- TOPIC: "${topic}"
- DIFFICULTY_DISTRIBUTION: ${JSON.stringify(difficulty_distribution)}
- FORMATO_SAIDA: JSON

Rules for question creation:
1. Produce exactly ${num_questions} questions.
2. Each question must have exactly 5 options labeled A, B, C, D, E.
3. Questions may be single-choice or multiple-choice; always state at the end of the question: (Number of correct answers: X).
4. Provide the answer key and explanations immediately after all questions.
5. For each option in the answer key, include a clear explanation (at least 2 full sentences) of why it is correct or incorrect.
6. Mix original questions and credible, publicly available sample questions (rephrased).
7. Encourage scenario-based stems that avoid ambiguity.

3. Questions may be single-choice or multiple-choice; always state at the end of the question: (Number of correct answers: X).
4. Provide the answer key and explanations immediately after all questions.
5. For each option in the answer key, include a clear explanation (at least 2 full sentences) of why it is correct or incorrect.
6. Mix original questions and credible, publicly available sample questions (rephrased).
7. Encourage scenario-based stems that avoid ambiguity.
8. Do not use "All of the above" or "None of the above.".
9. Distribute questions across difficulty levels according to the DIFFICULTY_DISTRIBUTION.
10. Explanations must connect to real Commerce Cloud functions (Backoffice, SmartEdit, PIM, promotions, workflows).
11. Shuffle correct answer positions.
12. Output must be 'strict JSON only'.

Output format: If FORMATO_SAIDA is "json", return a single JSON object with keys 'questions' and 'answer_key' exactly as described.
JSON format (exact schema, required when FORMATO_SAIDA is "json"):
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "...",
      "correct_count": 1,
      "options": {"A":"...","B":"...","C":"...","D":"...","E":"..."},
      "topic_subarea": "catalog",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "estimated_time_sec": 90
    }
  ],
  "answer_key": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "correct_options": ["A","C"],
      "explanations": {"A":"...","B":"...","C":"...","D":"...","E":"..."}
    }
  ]
}

Acceptance criteria (model must satisfy when returning JSON):
1. The top-level object must be valid JSON and parseable by JSON.parse.
2. The number of items in questions must equal NUM_QUESTIONS.
3. Each question must have exactly five options A..E.
4. Each question's correct_count must match the length of correct_options in the answer_key for that id.
5. answer_key must contain one entry for each question id and each explanations must include keys A..E with at least 2 full sentences per explanation.
6. difficulty values must be one of ["easy","medium","hard"] and distribution across questions should approximately follow DIFFICULTY_DISTRIBUTION.
7. Do not include extraneous top-level keys; return only the JSON object described.
8. If any rule cannot be satisfied, return a JSON object with an error field explaining which acceptance rule failed.
